## Vancouver Property Value Analysis

### 1: Overview
With home prices in Vancouver at record highs over recent years, many are concerned about housing affordability, especially [the gap](https://globalnews.ca/news/4444324/metro-vancouver-home-prices-incomes/) between property values and the income of people currently living in Vancouver. If we can compare property values of homes in different neighborhoods of Vancouver and the socio-economic background of people who reside in those areas, we can identify neighborhoods where the affordability gap is particularly severe. To do this, we propose building a data visualization application that allows city lawmakers to visually explore property value and socio-economic data geographically mapped to Vancouver neighborhoods. Our app will show the distribution of property values across the city and allow users to filter on a specific neighborhood in order to compare property values with various socio-economic statistics for that neighborhood.
